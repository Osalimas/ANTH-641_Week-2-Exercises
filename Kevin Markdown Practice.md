# Why I love Digital Archaeology

Digital Arch allows us to rethink how archaeology is done and how it impacts communities. 

As the authors note in ODAT:
>Digital archaeology of the 21st century is necessarily a public archaeology. Public archaeology seeks to promote awareness of what archaeology is, how it is done, and why it matters amongst members of the general audience. Engagement or working with various publics where there are clear differences in power is central in public archaeology, efforts that are highly variable and contingent on local circumstances. This is the principal difference with digital work that has come before, for never forget, current scholarship is preceded by at least a half-century of innovative use of computational power for archaeological knowledge building (Ethan Watrall 2017).

I'm interested in:
+ the impact of digital technologies on archaeologists
+ how to make use of all the data we create
+ ways to utilize digital technologies to enage the public.

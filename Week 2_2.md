# Week 2: Exercise 2 – Markdown
_This exercise is based on [ODAT 1.1.6](https://o-date.github.io/draft/book/so-what-is-digital-archaeology.html) exercises._

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor. 
1.	Read the first three main paragraphs in [ODAT 1.1.6 exercises](https://o-date.github.io/draft/book/so-what-is-digital-archaeology.html).
2.	Go to the site [Dillinger.io](https://dillinger.io/).
3.	Click anywhere in the Markdown text editor. Press ctrl A, and delete all of the text.  

4.	Rename the document to “[YOUR NAME] Markdown Practice
5.	Now use this Markdown [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) to practice your Markdown skills and talk about why you’re interested in digital archaeology. Include a Header, bullet points, a block quote from something in the ODAT text, and an image from the web. Here are two youtube videos if you want additional help.

6.	When you’re done, click the ‘export as’ dropdown, and select ‘markdown’. Keep a note of where the file has downloaded to on your machine.
Upload to GitHub
1.	In your GitHub page, open your repository “ANTH 641_Week 2” 
2.	Click on the button Upload file. Choose your Markdown file you exported from Dillinger.io
3.	Click on the green Commit Changes. You should now be able to see your file in the repo – click on it to see what it looks like. 
4.	You can continue to edit your Markdown file by clicking on your file in the repo and then clicking on the pencil. 
5.	Add two more different aspects to your Markdown practice file that you hadn’t used before. Remember you can use the [cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet).
